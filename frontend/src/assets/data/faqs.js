    question: "WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THERAPY DOGS AND SERVICE DOGS??",
    content:
      "Therapy dogs are used to comfort people at places such as hospitals, nursing homes, behavioral health centers, doctors’ offices and more. A service dog is specifically trained to aid veterans and others who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. At Got Your Six, we are able to train both service dogs and therapy dogs.",

  {
    question: "HOW CAN I GET INVOLVED??",
    content:
      "We offer therapy dog classes for those who want to make a difference in their communities. Your dog must pass an initial evaluation then you’ll both need to attend at least 10 classes, shadow 10 visits and pass the AKC Canine Good Citizen and Community Canine tests.",
  },
  {
    question: "HOW MUCH DOES THE PROGRAM COST??",
    content:
      "Classes are $10 each and your dog must attend at least 10, there is a $100 supply fee to cover the dog’s vest, badges and 250 trading cards. Consider these small fees as a donation to the community as your dog’s therapy training will greatly help many in your community.",

    question: "CAN MY PUPPY BE TRAINED AS A THERAPY DOG?",
    content:
      "Sadly, no. This should not be your dog’s first source of training. All therapy dogs must be at least a year old, pass basic and intermediate group training classes, pass the AKC Good Citizen test and pass our initial pre-training screening evaluation. It’s hard work to be a therapy dog, unfortunately puppies just aren’t quite ready to take it on. Enjoy their time as a puppy, then we’ll welcome them into training with open arms.",

    question: "DO YOU SELL ANY MERCHANDISE?",
    content:
      "Of course! We have a full online store of apparel and gift options. A portion of the proceeds comes back to support the training and placement process for our service dogs. We would love to see you rocking the Got Your Six Support Dogs apparel.",
